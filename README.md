I would like to show you how my mobile application works in this moment. Its not all what I would like to get at the end. There is alot to do with it yet. But despite of that I think its good moment to show something to you becouse something finally works here. What you can really see here on phone screen is image from phone camera. The algorithm was implemented to work in real time.
